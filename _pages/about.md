# Welcome Note

Hello hello, welcome to my personal website!
My name is Qitan Lv (in Chinese: 吕奇澹). Due to [polyphony](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%A4%9A%E9%9F%B3%E5%AD%97/10884829) (where characters can have multiple pronunciations), I'm also called EGG ( •̀ ω •́ )✧.

# About Me
I'm currently a first-year master's student at the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). My research interest includes knowledge graphs, large language models, and natural language processing. For more information, please check out my [CV](https://shiliu-egg.github.io/cv/).

I hold the belief that principles are more fundamental than solutions and should generally take precedence.  I also have a great fondness for elegant and efficient designs. These values motivated most of my works.


# For more infomation

Here’s a bit more infomation about me that might help to know me better:

1. I'm from Sichuan, but I'm not great with spicy food.
2. I've played a bunch of games like StarCraft II, DOTA2, and WarCraftIII, but I'm not skilled at any of them.
3. I'm a littile bit introverted and laid-back, and I lean towards socializing online.
4. I'm still a student, hoping to create something meaningful with what I learn.
5. TBD...
